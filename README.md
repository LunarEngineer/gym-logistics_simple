The logistics environment is a single agent domain featuring continuous state and discrete action spaces.

## Simple Logistics Environment

In this environment there is a 'road' network created when the environment is created. This network is constructed from a number of nodes and edges of various lengths. One node is always the 'logistics hub' where trucks are 'packed' and 'dispatched' from.

A number of 'customers' travel on the highways surrounding the logistics hub. The customers will always be consuming their resources at various rates and will travel the network at a fixed speed.

The distribution hub only has a certain number of trucks available of different types. Different classes of supply may be loaded onto different trucks.
